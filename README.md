EIM - Email Instant Messaging
=============================

Email Instant Messaging (EIM) is the solution to treat your email like instant messages:

Simply log in to one of your email accounts (e.g. GMail or AOL) and your messages from the last few days will automatically be fetched.
After that the messenger with all your latest contacts and messages opens in an instant messaging-style and you will receive notifications for every newly received mail.
