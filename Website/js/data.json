			"question": "Do I need any prerequisite software for using EIM?",
			"answer": "If you want to use EIM under Windows or Mac OS X you don't need any other software, just install EIM and start using it. If you want to use EIM via the 'Cross' download, you need to install a <a href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html' target='_blank'>JRE</a> first."

        {
			"type": "os",
			"question": "Is it possible to use EIM under my Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, ...)/Linux-like/other operating system?",
			"answer": "It should be possible for every operating system that supports a current Java platform to run EIM. Just download EIM via the 'Cross' option under 'Downloads'. Be aware that your operating system may not have been (fully) tested and that EIM may not be well integrated into it."

		},
        {
			"type": "provider",
			"question": "Where do I find my provider's server data?",
			"answer": "If your provider is not being listed in the account wizard, you will need your provider's server data (IMAP and SMTP) to continue. For best results google search for '&lt;your provider name&gt; IMAP SMTP', e.g. 'University of California Berkeley IMAP SMTP'. Search results like 'Client settings for...' or 'How do I set up IMAP in ...' will appear most likely."

To enable or disable it, go to 'Preferences', select or deselect this option and click on 'Ok'."
